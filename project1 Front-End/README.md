[Link to the repo](https://github.com/alejandro-baez/frontend-mv)

### **Overview**

The Fitness Wiki app is designed to be your #1 exercise learning platform. By fetching exercise data such as names, tutorials, and targeted body areas from the ExerciseDB API and displaying them in an organized and straightforward fashion, Fitness Wiki strives to be your one-stop-shop for everything exercise related. Users are able to search for specific exercises or body areas that they wish to target and can access more information on specific exercises if desired.

**What are the users?**
This app is intended for anyone who is remotely interested in exploring and learning about exercises. It could be beginners who are interested in researching which exercises are the most effective, as well as those with experience who may need a refresher.

**What job does it form for them?**
The Fitness Wiki App simplifies the process of researching specific exercises or even finding similar exercises that target a specific target area. It also provides a tutorial on how to effectively perform said exercises with accompanying gifs.

**What inspired you to make it?**
Growing up my father was a big fitness enthusiast. He’d play basketball every weekend and workout during the weekdays. Although I was young at the time, I wanted to be like him and be active. I then started my fitness journey and decided to create an app to reflect that.

**What features are the most important?**
Fetching and displaying exercise from the ExerciseDB API with gifs and accompanying information. This allows the users to fully explore exercises and grow their knowledge. The added search function is also an important feature that provides accurate results depending on the specific exercise or target body area.


### **STAR Interview**:

S- To demonstrate the culmination of our knowledge after we completed the front end module, we were tasked with developing a front end application using React. This application would utilize external API’s and alongside CSS and ultimately be a functional and presentable app

T- The first major task of the project for me was to come up with the actual idea of the project. I wanted to create something that was interesting and that I could relate to. I also wanted to focus on one of my weakest skills in web development, CSS and design. Compared to the rest of my programming skills, I am always struggling with creating an application that is visually appealing, at least to me.

A- Instead of rushing and glossing over the app design and style, I watched various CSS and Flexbox tutorials to get a deeper understanding of what I needed to improve on. I read the various Flexbox cheat sheets to help with my app organization and did a lot of trial and error to see what worked and what didn’t.

R- As a result, I was able to gain a new found appreciation for CSS and design. I still have a long way to go in my front end journey but I’m definitely more confident in my skills than I was before.  In my opinion, this application is one of my most visually appealing projects in my repertoire and I’m proud of the end product. 


## Technologies
- React 18
- JavaScript
- Node v14
- Git and Github
- Rapid API’s ExerciseDB


## Competencies
### JF 2.2 Can identify relevant and up-to-date software designs and how to read and implement functional/technical specifications

A large part of this project was dependent on RapidAPI’s ExerciseDB external API. Due to this, I spent a good chunk of time reading the documentation and calling ExerciseDB multiple times to see how to properly utilize and mold it to my specific requirements.

### JF 6.4 Works independently and takes responsibility. For example, has a disciplined and responsible approach to risk, and stays motivated and committed when facing challenges

This entire project was done independently and right from the beginning, I knew that developing my CSS and design skills was going to be a challenge. There were several moments when certain styling choices took longer to implement but I had to stay motivated and committed toi do what I had to do.

### JF 1.6 Can follow software designs and functional/technical specifications

For the most part, I created my own functional and technical specifications. For example, I wanted to implement a search feature that led to an individual exercise page. I planned how I could mold the ExerciseDB API to return the individual information to create the single exercise page.
