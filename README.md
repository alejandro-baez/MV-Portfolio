## Portfolio Introduction
**Who am I?** Hello everyone! My name is Alejandro Baez. I am a New York City native. Born and raised in Queens, I have lived in the same two blocks my whole life. I’m currently working as a Software Engineer Apprentice at Warner Music Group in New York. Thanks to WMG, I have been exposed to using Python to optimize API endpoints as well as using Typescript to tweak specific data on the UX side. Ultimately this has given an interest in full stack software engineering. Being able to work on an endpoint and then follow it to the front end where it is fully implemented makes me feel like I’m making a difference. 

**Why I do what I do?** I have always loved technology and its seemingly endless capabilities. It all started when I built my own gaming computer at the age of 13 and spent hours getting exposed to the amazing apps that people were developing. At the time, it seemed otherworldly and something that I would never be able to do. But I knew better than that and since then, I’ve been in the pursuit of developing my skills to become the best software engineer I can be. I’m constantly learning new tech stacks and seeking out new challenges. I hope to one day be in a position to mentor and foster the next generation of software engineers.   

**Your areas of interest** Warner Music Group has helped immensely to hone in on my interests by allowing me to work on both frontend and backend features. This has allowed me to realize that my greatest strengths are when I’m working with Python on the backend. Data is crucial and being able to manipulate data to then send to the UX or even to another endpoint interests me. I would also like to focus more on cloud computing as there are a lot of opportunities to create amazing applications.
